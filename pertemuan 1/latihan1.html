    <h1>Films with Sam Siegel Productions</h1>
    <h2>The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)</h2>
    <p>Produces by Sam Siegel, this film was the first of
        the Lean blockbuster movies, and featured a young Alec
        Guinnes, William Holden, and a brilliant performance
        from Sessue Hayakawa.

    <h3>Lawrencr of Arabia (1962)</h3>
    One of my all-time favorite movies, this epic
    adventure starring Peter O'Toole established Lean as
    a director who could truly envision film on a grand scale.
